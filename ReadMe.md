# Stock Market Prediction
## General Idea:
### I am trying to build up a neural network to prediction stock market. Dataset is Google Finance or Yahoo Finance. At least 5 years data, longer is accepted.

## 1. Model Selection
### I have two options: First is from scratch like using numpy and other low-level libarary to create a model, which can train me the deeper understanding of creating a model. I also have option #2, which is using existing libs like TensorFlow, Pytorch, or Keras.

## 2. Dataset Selection
### I can use Google Finance or Yahoo Finance to train my model. I assume I still need to use them as testing data. And using the current data to test how the performance is.
